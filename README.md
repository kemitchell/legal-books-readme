I confidently recommend the following legal books to all readers interested in contracts, negotiation, and business. They will be especially helpful for budding contracts attorneys, as they have been to
me.

Some focus on areas of business, or even specific forms, very remote from my practice. But I found in each some kernel of universal utility or inspiration.

---

- _The American Bar Association Legal Guide for Small Business_

  (General)

  Broad, shallow summary of laws and regs affecting business. Helps suss out gaps in familiarity.

- Donald S. Passman's _All You Need to Know about the Music Business_

  (Copyright; Commercial Contracts)

  A whirlwind tour of music industry contracts. Very lively style. Includes "market" rates for royalties and others cuts.

- _The American Institute of Architects Official Guide to the 2007 AIA Contract Documents_

  (Construction; Commercial Contracts)

  A somewhat repetitive, comprehensive review of the core standard construction forms. Very nicely bound.

- Daniel J. Solove and Paul Schwartz' _Information Privacy Law_

  (Privacy)

  Still the best general reference on information privacy laws. Unfortunate casebook binding, price.

- Richard Wright and Warren Coke's _The LSTA's Complete Credit Agreement Guide_

  (Credit)

  Comprehensive walkthrough of an industry group form. Good coverage of some standard boilerplate provisions.

- David Mellinkoff's _The Language of the Law_

  (Drafting; Plain English)

  Scholarly work tracing history of legal words and phrases, with criticism of their longevity.

- Ward Farnsworth's _The Legal Analyst_

  (Theory)

  Whirlwind tour of common threads in legal academia. Chapters are short and largely self-contained.

- Kenneth A. Adams' _A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting_

  (Drafting; Plain English)

  Style manual for contracts.

- Tina L. Stark's _Negotiating and Drafting Contract Boilerplate_

  (Drafting)

  Team-written overview of common boilerplate provisions. Modern style. Good, but not complete coverage. Scandalously expensive.

- Lawrence Rosen's _Open Source Licensing_

  (Software; Copyright; Patent)

  Approachable introduction. Well written for technical readers.

- Dermot Berkery's _Raising Venture Capital for the Serious Entrepreneur_

  (Venture Capital)

  Good introduction to financing terms. Better than average coverage of inter-round dynamics and investment analysis.

- Bruce R. Hopkins' _Starting and Managing a Nonprofit Organization_

  (Tax; Nonprofits)

  Serviceable reduction of the author's treatise.

- Matthew Butterick's _Typography for Lawyers_

  (Drafting)

  Simple prescriptions for better print presentations. Litigation-focused in its examples.
